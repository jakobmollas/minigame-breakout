# minigame-breakout

Based on Atari 2600 Breakout

Implemented using Html5 canvas, html/css and pure Javascript.

* Use mouse to move bat
* Mouse click/space to launch ball
* Does not (yet) support mobile devices, use in desktop browser

Using a library like P5.js would simplify a lot of things but I wanted to see how hard it would be to work with vanilla js + canvas only, which was pretty straight-forward, at least for this game.
